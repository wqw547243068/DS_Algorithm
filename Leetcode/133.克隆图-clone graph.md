## 克隆图
- 考察最基本的图的遍历，深度遍历和宽度遍历
题目如下：
Given the head of a graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node in the graph contains a label (int) and a list (List[UndirectedGraphNode]) of its neighbors. There is an edge between the given node and each of the nodes in its neighbors.

OJ’s undirected graph serialization (so you can understand error output):
Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use # as a separator for each node, and , as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.

As an example, consider the serialized graph {0,1,2#1,2#2,2}.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by #.

First node is labeled as 0. Connect node 0 to both nodes 1 and 2.
Second node is labeled as 1. Connect node 1 to node 2.
Third node is labeled as 2. Connect node 2 to node 2 (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.

Visually, the graph looks like the following:
```
   1
  / \
 /   \
0 --- 2
     / \
     \_/
```
Note: The information about the tree serialization is only meant so that you can understand error output if you get a wrong answer. You don’t need to understand the serialization to solve the problem.

## 思路
- DFS
- BFS


## 代码
- DFS
```python
#深度优先遍历解法
# Definition for a undirected graph node
# class UndirectedGraphNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.label = x
#         self.neighbors = []

class Solution:
    # @param node, a undirected graph node
    # @return a undirected graph node
    def cloneGraph(self, node):
        if None == node: return None
        nodeMap = {}
        return self.cloneNode(node, nodeMap)

    def cloneNode(self, node, nodeMap):#注意理解这个函数的意思，就是clone一个node
        if None == node:
            return None
        #访问当前点，这里不是简单的print，而是复制，若已经复制，即这个node已经被创建，则返回副本
        if node in nodeMap.keys():#node
            return nodeMap[node]
        #若没有副本，则复制一份，同样处理其邻接点
        else:
            clone = UndirectedGraphNode(node.label)
            nodeMap[node] = clone
            #访问其邻居节点
            for neighbor in node.neighbors:
                clone.neighbors.append(self.cloneNode(neighbor, nodeMap))
        return clone
```


- BFS
```python
# Definition for a undirected graph node
# class UndirectedGraphNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.label = x
#         self.neighbors = []

class Solution:
    # @param node, a undirected graph node
    # @return a undirected graph node
    # @BFS
    def cloneGraph(self, node):
        if node == None: return None
        queue = []; map = {}
        newhead = UndirectedGraphNode(node.label)
        queue.append(node)
        map[node] = newhead
        while queue:
            curr = queue.pop()
            for neighbor in curr.neighbors:
                if neighbor not in map:
                    copy = UndirectedGraphNode(neighbor.label)
                    map[curr].neighbors.append(copy)
                    map[neighbor] = copy
                    queue.append(neighbor)
                else:
                    # turn directed graph to undirected graph
                    map[curr].neighbors.append(map[neighbor])
        return newhead
```
