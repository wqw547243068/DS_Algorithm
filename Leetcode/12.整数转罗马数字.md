## 12.[整数转罗马数字](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/integer-to-roman)
Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.
```
Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
```
For example
- two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. 
- Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. 
- The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.



### 解题思路
#### 思路一
****
>  键值对 + 循环遍历  
首先根据转换关系创建一个对应表（字典），接着对字典的值进行降序排列，遍历字典去查找num对应的罗马字符  


**python实现代码**
```python
class Solution:
    def intToRoman(self, num):
        """
        :type num: int
        :rtype: str
        """
        lookup = {
            'M': 1000, 
            'CM': 900, 
            'D': 500, 
            'CD': 400, 
            'C': 100, 
            'XC': 90, 
            'L': 50, 
            'XL': 40, 
            'X': 10, 
            'IX': 9, 
            'V': 5, 
            'IV': 4, 
            'I': 1
        }
        roman = ''
        for symbol, val in sorted(lookup.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True):
            while num >= val:
                roman += symbol
                num -= val
        return roman 
```
### 备注

注意：
- 时间复杂度O(n)，可以优化成二分查找
- 区分千百十个位，按照整数的位数来划分
